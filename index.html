		<h1>Who’s going to care about your video?</h1>
		<pre>
Your friends?
Your family?
Your client?
Your client’s client?

Why did you make it?

To get paid?
To build your portfolio?
To make a connection?
To do a favor for your family friend?

Is that enough for you?
Because that wasn’t enough for us.

That is why we are building a team of content creators.

Making deadlines, getting paid, having your friend’s coworker tweet it out?
Those should be givens. Not goals.

We want to create videos that will amaze people not just because some Facebook ad told them they should be amazed.

We want every frame of a project to be like a work of art in a museum.
Hand-made with the upmost passion and precision.
Crafted by talented visionaries that love doing what they do.

However, most of the content today is garbage.
But a lot people watch that stuff.
You can make money making garbage!
But being a creator of content like that is like being a factory work at the lipstick on pigs factory.
BUT if that’s what you want to do, have at it! (you can even have our extra lipstick) 

But what WE want to create are works of art that are raw.
That are professional.
That are beautiful.
That outlive the present
That outlive the future
That outlive the fad
That outlive us.

We aren’t talking about 6 second 8mm films screened on a
cardboard box on a Sunday night in a basement in DTLA.

We are talking about authentically beautiful content that everyone will be talking about

We are building a team of creators of this content.

Creators.

Not a group of kids with access to RED Cameras and swimsuit models
Not a pair of guys shooting club videos on GoPros that hide behind a VHS filter.
Not a think tank of “artists” that enjoy putting lipstick on pigs.

That is why we are building a team of content creators.

Are you interested?
